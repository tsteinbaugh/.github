# Automating GitHub Issue Creation from a Bulleted List

## Steps to Automate GitHub Issue Creation

Step 1: Get GitHub API Token
1. Go to GitHub's Personal Access Tokens page.
1. Create a new token with the required permissions to create issues. The repo scope should be enough for private repositories.
1. Copy your token — you'll need it for the script.

Step 2: Prepare the Bulleted List
Prepare your list in a simple text format. Here's an example of what the .txt file could look like:

Example (bulleted_list.txt):  
pgsql

- Fix the login button alignment
- Update homepage header text
- Add contact form on the website
- Implement user authentication

Step 3: Install Dependencies

You will need to install the requests library to interact with GitHub's API. You can install it by running:

bash

```pip install requests```

Step 4: Python Script to Automate GitHub Issues

Use the following Python script to read the bullet list and create GitHub issues. This script assumes that the bullet points are in a .txt file.

python

```
import requests

# GitHub repository details
owner = "your_github_username"  # Replace with your GitHub username or organization name
repo = "your_repository_name"   # Replace with your repository name
token = "your_github_token"     # Replace with your personal access token

# Read bullet points from your text file
def read_bullet_points(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return [line.strip('- ').strip() for line in file.readlines() if line.startswith('-')]

# Create a GitHub issue
def create_issue(title, description=""):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"token {token}",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "title": title,
        "body": description
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Successfully created issue: {title}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to create issue: {title} - {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

# Automate issue creation
def automate_issues(file_path):
    bullet_points = read_bullet_points(file_path)
    for point in bullet_points:
        create_issue(point)

# Run the automation with your list file
if __name__ == "__main__":
    automate_issues("bulleted_list.txt")  # Replace with your actual file path
```

Step 5: Run the Script

1. Replace the placeholders in the script:
- "your_github_username" with your GitHub username or organization name.
- "your_repository_name" with your repository's name.
- "your_github_token" with your personal access token.
1. Save the script as create_github_issues.py.
1. Run the script using:

bash

```python create_github_issues.py```

How the Script Works:
- The script reads the bullet points from the file (bulleted_list.txt).
- It sends requests to GitHub’s API to create an issue for each bullet point.
- The script outputs success or failure messages based on whether the issue was created successfully.
